\section{Introduction}
LaTeX is a high-quality typesetting system, especially suitable for writing academic papers and technical documents. It offers powerful features for formatting mathematical formulas and managing references.

\section{Mathematical Formula}
Here is a simple mathematical formula:

\[
E = mc^2
\]

Where \(E\) is energy, \(m\) is mass, and \(c\) is the speed of light.

\section{Inserting Images}
You can also insert images into your document. Here is how you would do that:


\textbf{\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.25\linewidth]{zhw.jpg}
\caption{\label{fig:zhw}weixin.}
\end{figure}}

\section{Conclusion}
This is a simple LaTeX example. By using this template, you can learn how to write documents in LaTeX, including mathematical formulas and images.
